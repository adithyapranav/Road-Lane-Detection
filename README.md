# Road-Lane-Detection
This is a Project which tracks road lane using Computer Vision Techniques.                                
The pipeline we use for this project is the follow:                                      
Input frame -> Greyscale -> Gaussian Blur -> Canny -> Segment -> Hough -> Output frame                          
I used Python3 and OpenCV                               
All methods and Their Functionality are specified in the Code.
